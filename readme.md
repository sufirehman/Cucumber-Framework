How to Run the Project:


Make sure you have Java JDK 17.0.8.
Make sure you have ChromeDriver installed and the chrome driver and chrome browser versions are same.
Make sure you have GeckoDriver installed and the Gecko driver and Firefox browser versions are same.

In order to change browser change the browser type in BrowserDriver class
Change the paths of ChromeDriver and GeckoDriver to your system paths where these drivers are installed.

ExtentReport is created only for addToCart test scenarios so create a folder in your own system and then set its path in the ExtentManager class.
